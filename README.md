# GeneratorCollections
A collection of schematics that are used by the Generator in the [BuildTeamTools](https://github.com/BuildTheEarth/BuildTeamTools) plugin

## Collections
The Generator collections repository contains multiple collections that are used for different purposes.<br><br>

**TreePack:**<br>
The Tree Pack is used to install hundreds of trees with different variations.
Those can then be used by the Tree Generator to quickly generate trees of any kind.

**FieldPack:**<br>
The Field Pack contains a collection of multiple different Field Patterns of different orientations.
Those can then be used by the Field Generator to quickly generate fields in any orientation and angle.

# Field Pack

The field pack contains a list of 20 field direction patterns.<br>
When the player generated a field, the correct pattern is selected based on the players YAW value to make sure that the field is facing a similiar direction that the player is looking at.<br>
There are two categories for the field patterns: <br>
- `NORMAL` - Normal lines for potato or harvested fields
- `STRIPED` - Striped lines for vineyard and pears fields
